# Game Of Life

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

Description:
This project implements a simulation of Conway’s Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. The game takes place on an n × n grid, where each cell can be either alive (true) or dead (false). The simulation evolves over a fixed number of generations, following a set of simple rules that determine the state of each cell in the next generation based on the states of its eight neighboring cells.

Rules of the Game:

A live cell with exactly 2 or 3 live neighbors stays alive on the next generation.

A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive in the next generation.

All other cells die or remain dead in the next generation.

Features:

Uses a 2D array of boolean values to represent the grid.

Supports configurable grid size (n × n) and number of generations.

Displays each generation of the simulation.

Demonstrates core programming concepts like arrays, loops, and conditional logic.

# How to Run

## Installation

Install my-project with npm

```bash

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/richaanant/conways-game-of-life.git

# Go into the project folder
cd conways-game-of-life

# Compile the program (if using Java)
javac Project1.java

## Future Improvements
Add a graphical interface (GUI) to visualize the grid.

Allow user input for grid size and initial pattern.

Save and load starting configurations.
